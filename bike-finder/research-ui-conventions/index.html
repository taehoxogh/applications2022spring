    <h1>Researching UI Conventions</h1>
    
    <div class="stores">
        <h3>Macy’s</h3>
        <p>
            I tried to find a black zip clutch using Macy’s website. Macy’s website had checkboxes on the left side of their webpage 
            so that customers can filter items by wallet brand, wallet style and materials. At the top right side of the all items, 
            there were dropdown menus to sort items by their price, ratings or arrival dates. The website also had a search box for 
            users who try to look for the items by their names. After clicking the product I am interested, 
            I found some similar items showed on the right side and I was able to magnify the products to see the details of the product. 
            “Add to bag” button (CTA) had bright and clear color with high contrast allowing users to lead users action. 
            For those who do not have an account on this website, they had a button “Checkout as guest” to offer convenient ways of purchasing products for users.
        </p>

        <h3>The RealReal</h3>
        <p>
            I was looking for a mens size 9 GUCCI sneakers on a secondhand product online website. This website required customers 
            to sign up for their website before looking around the mall which is very unusual for online shopping mall. 
            They did not have filter checkboxes on the leftside, they only had categories on the top with search bar at the right side. 
            I had to click mens menu first followed by clicking “Sneakers”. After clicking the button, the checkbox appeared so that users can 
            filter depending on their size and style of the sneakers. They had interesting filter options such as “Editors’ Picks”, “Vintage”.  As other shopping websites, 
            “Add to Cart” button was located at the right center with a black rectangle with high contrast on white background. While filling out information about my credit card and address, 
            they were showing a message saying “Your shopping bad will expire in 8:41” to urge users to complete their purchase.
        </p>

    <div class="stores">
        <h3>Walmart</h3>
        <p>
            Interested item in this store was a polar bear stuffed animal. Walmart had a search bar on the center at the top, 
            and right next to it, it had “Department” section and “Services” section. I directly searched on the search bar 
            by typing “Polar bear stuffed animal”. It showed several items for “polar bear stuffed animal”. It had dropdown menus 
            for filter the items such as price, brand, departments and pickup&shipping. “Add to Cart” button was a big blue 
            rounded-edge-rectangle. Similar to Macy’s, it had a button for non-members to easily proceed to check out. 

        </p>

    <div class="stores">
        <h3>Academy</h3>
        <p>
            One of the item that I tried to purchase was orange size 5 soccer ball. This website had a hamburger button to open 
            checkboxes for filtering the item. Checkboxes were for filters by their brand, ball size, price, ratings. After choosing the item,
            I could simply change the quantity of items by clicking + or - button which I felt convenient. “Add to Cart” button was a big blue
            rectangle with high contrast on white background to promote users click. They did not ask to sign in to purchase the product 
            and directly led to payment page with shipping information. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="findings">
        <h3>What elements or patterns seem universal?</h3>
        <p>I found that shopping mall websites have similar UI elements in general. They had checkbox filters so that users can easily find 
            what they are looking for depending on their materials, price range, colors and so forth. Also CTAs were highlighted with a 
            bright color to induce users action. All of the websites I have visited had a search box which is very convenient for users 
            to find what they are looking for by items name.
        </p>

        <h3>What elements or patterns were specific to the store or product?</h3>
        <p>Secondhand market normally has limited number of stocked for certain item. Therefore it asks users to decide to buy 
            the product in a limited time (10-20mins) showing the remaining time. I realized that a shop with higher price product 
            tends not to have “quantity” box on the product page.
        </p>

        <h3>Did I see anything that felt different or unusual?</h3>
        <p>I found that a little bit of different filter factors for items. For example, Macy’s found a filter option for 
            “discount range” which was not a usual case. I also realized that some websites use dropdown menu rather than 
            checkbox for filtering items. Each website had their own style of showing their product. For example, I was only
            able to magnify the product through the Macy’s website, but I could rotate the product with magnifying function 
            on the Academy website. One website that I found required “Sign up” to shop in their website, and it was interesting
            to see the website showing a message to urge users to complete their purchase while entering credit card number and
            shipping information.
        </p>

        <h3>Any stand out patterns? Could any other stores have applied that technique?</h3>
        <p>I found it interesting that all websites I observed had “highlighted” CTA. I think this attracts users to click
            the button and encourages users to purchase more.  I think this is really important for any other stores because
            it is directly related to goal of the market. 
        </p>

        <h3>How did you feel when interacting with these sites? When were you happiest/most comfortable? When were you disrupted/confused/bothered?</h3>
        <p>I felt that websites were design based on users shopping flow which offers users convenient way to purchase
            what they want. They gave me a lot of information that users might wonder about and all the processes I had
            to do to purchase the product was very simple and intuitive. I also felt that websites are using a lot of
            psychological tricks to induce users action for their goal (increasing profit). I was really happy and comfortable when I found way
            to checkout without a membership. It has been frustrating for me if I could only checkout with an account.
            I was really bothered to see the remaining time of checkout, it made me really nervous while filling out all the information.
