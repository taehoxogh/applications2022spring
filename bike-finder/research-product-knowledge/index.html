    <h1>Buying a bike</h1>

    <h3>Sources (Educating Yourself)</h3>
    <p>
        I started thinking about what was the pain-point when I rode a bike from my own experience. I found interesting articles 
        from online <a href = "https://communitycyclingcenter.org/top-5-things-to-consider-when-buying-a-new-or-used-bike/">cycling community center</a>
        about things to consider when buying a bike. I also looked at <a href = "https://www.bikesonline.com/"> bike online store </a> to learn about different 
        kind of bikes. <a href = "https://www.yellowjersey.co.uk/the-draft/buying-a-bike/">Ultimate beginner guide to buying a bike</a> gave me brief
        features of different type of bikes. To get an idea of the size of the bike, I read an article <a href = "https://www.bicycle-guider.com/bike-articles/bike-size-chart/">Bike Size Chart</a>

    </p>
    
    <h4>What YOU would want if you were actually buying a bike for yourself today? What would you use it for? What features do you care about? How will you know if it fits you? How will you select a brand and price point?</h4>
    <p>Based on my experience, my painpoint of riding a bike was climbing up the hill while riding a bike. 
        I want to buy a bike just to commute to school with a bike but there are a lot hills. Also since 
        the school is far away from my home I am hoping to buy a high speed bike, but I can only afford up to $100. 
        I know my height. Based on the source <a href = "https://www.bicycle-guider.com/bike-articles/bike-size-chart/">Bike Size Chart</a>, I found that the right size bike for me is 16-17inch. 
        I personally do not care about the brand of the bike. Therefore the most important thing in choosing a bike will be a type of bike based on my needs.
    </p>

    <h4>What big questions will a buyer will be faced with? What are the priorities when selecting a bike?</h4>
    <p>
        The big question the buyer will have is “Will this bike make my commute easier and convenient? and will it be worth it? <br>
        From the source, I know that mountain bike is easy to climb up the hill, and road bike is faster on the road. 
        From the source, <a href = "https://www.yellowjersey.co.uk/the-draft/buying-a-bike/">Ultimate beginner guide to buying a bike</a>, I found that there is a type of bike that combined together,
        which is “hybrid bike”. The right size bike for me is 16 - 17inch bike. Therefore I decided to look for a hybrid bike below $1000,
        within the size range 16-17inch on the bike store.

    <h3>Purchase the bike from online websites</h3>
    <p>These are the websites that I checked<br><br>
        <a href="https://www.bikesonline.com/">www.bikesonline.com/</a><br>
        <a href="https://www.summitbicycles.com/">www.summitbicycles.com/</a>
    </p>

    <h4>What did you experience in this website, what did you run into that you didn't understand, and now you do?</h4>
    <p>
        <ul><a href="https://www.bikesonline.com/">www.bikesonline.com/</a></ul>
        There was a menu “Bikes” and I was able to choose “City&Hybrid”. There was checkboxes for filter on the left side. 
        I tried to choose ~$1000 and 16-17 inch bike based on my need. But the wheel size was not in inch, it was just number 
        ending with alphabet ”c” which did not make sense to me. I thought it would be great if they have clear explanation 
        about this or conversion calculator for it. Finally, since the brand does not matter to me so much, I decided to choose
        the bike based on the ratings from users.

        <ul><a href="https://www.summitbicycles.com/">www.summitbicycles.com/</a></ul>
        There was a menu “Bikes” and I was able to choose “Hybrid”. There was checkboxes for filter on the left side as usual.
        On this website, there was checkboxes for the size with “inch” unit which was very easy to understand. I also checked the price
        range below $1000. I only had one option after filtering it.
        The bike looked like a one that I have been looking for. Therefore, I decided to buy this bike. The website was very intuitive
        and easy to complete the checkout. Everything was very smooth, and I did not face any difficulties using this website.
