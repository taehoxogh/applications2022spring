    <div class="Testing Round 1">
        
        <h1>Testing Round 1</h1>
        <ul><li>Hard time finding “Sign-up” button because the user wanted to sign-up before they start looking around the website. There was only sign-in button without sign-up</li></ul>
        <ul><li>The user who buys a bike for the first time had a hard time taking a quiz because it seems too difficult for them.
            (The user commented that it would have been nicer to have short quiz to guide users choosing right bike for them rather than long question just to educate the users)</li></ul>
        <ul><li>The user wants to compare the specs of multiple bikes that they own, and the user successfully accessed to lots of specs for comparison.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Top sales (Trending)</li></ul>
        <ul><li>The user wants to filter out bikes in their price range, but it seems it is a little pain for them to enter the price value for the price range every time. (The user commented that it would be good to have a bar so that they can choose the price range by just dragging it)</li></ul>
        <ul><li>The user who is health conscious, they couldn’t find any bikes that are recommended by health/fitness experts (The user commented that they want to see the recommendation of experts from the product list page before they go into detailed product page)</li></ul>
        <ul><li>The user who is looking for bikes on sale or discount successfully identified bikes that are on sale from the menu bar “Top sales”</li></ul>
    </div>

    <div class="Testing Round 2">
        
        <h1>Testing Round 2</h1>
        <ul><li>The user who got injured from riding a bike before had a hard time finding safety information.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>The user purchasing a bike for his child seems a bit confused about the filter section “Gender” because the filter only had “Kids” without kid’s gender. (The user commented that he wants to filter more specifically for “Kid boys”)</li></ul>
        <ul><li>The user wants to be able to quickly find the bike as few clicks as possible so that they don’t lose it trying to navigate all these pages and buttons, but the website does not show what it is filtered by after filtering. (The user commented that he wants to see where he is located currently)</li></ul>
        <ul><li>The user seems little bit confusing why she has to enter the height in the filter, and seems not sure if it is a requirement to use filter.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>The user who want to feel comfortable purchasing a bike without riding it successfully saw and read a detailed and reliable reviews on the detailed product page.</li></ul>
      </div>

      <div class="Testing Round 3">
        
        <h1>Testing Round 3</h1>
        <ul><li>For the first time bike buyer, it looks like that the quiz is too long and boring, it seems that the user wants to find what they want to get quickly not just educated. (I got the same comment from the round 1. The user got bored when they were on the quiz page because the question is complicated and long)</li></ul>
        <ul><li>The user who wants to find the right bikes for their child successfully sorted through different customization options to find right bikes in the detailed product page for their child. It seems intuitive to the user.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>For the first time user, the detailed information about the specification seems too overwhelming to them. It seems that they didn’t want to read all details about the spec but they want to read it if they are interested. (The user commented that it would be useful to have spec info with collapse and expand feature)</li></ul>
        <ul><li>The user who wants a versatile or gender neutral bike had a hard time finding gender neutral bike because there was only section for “Men, “Women, “Kids”. (The user commented that it would be good to have “Unisex” filter as well for someone who is looking for gender neutral bikes”)</li></ul>
        <ul><li>The user who wants a bike that is high quality but also not too expensive had a hard time finding a good one, because there were not any filters or menus for them. (The user commented that it would be good to have “Best value” filter or menu so that users can find high quality but not too expensive items)</li></ul>
